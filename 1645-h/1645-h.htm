IN JUNE.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">In</span> twilight of the
longest day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I lingered over Lucian,<br />
Till ere the dawn a dreamy way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My spirit found, untrod of man,<br />
Between the green sky and the grey.</p>
<p class="poetry">Amid the soft dusk suddenly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; More light than air I seemed to sail,<br />
Afloat upon the ocean sky,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While through the faint blue, clear and pale,<br />
I saw the mountain clouds go by:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My barque had thought for helm and sail,<br />
And one mist wreath for canopy.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>Like torches on a marble floor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Reflected, so the wild stars shone,<br />
Within the abysmal hyaline,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till the day widened more and more,<br />
And sank to sunset, and was gone,<br />
And then, as burning beacons shine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On summits of a mountain isle,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A light to folk on sea that
fare,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So the sky&rsquo;s beacons for a while<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Burned in these islands of the
air.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then from a starry island set<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where one swift tide of wind there flows,<br />
Came scent of lily and violet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Narcissus, hyacinth, and rose,<br />
Laurel, and myrtle buds, and vine,<br />
So delicate is the air and fine:<br />
And forests of all fragrant trees<br />

<p class="poetry">Between the daylight and the dark<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That island lies in silver air,<br />
And suddenly my magic barque<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wheeled, and ran in, and grounded there;<br />
And by me stood the sentinel<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Now all of ivory and gold<br />
The great walls were that garlanded<br />
The temples in their shining fold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (Each fane of beryl built, and each<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Girt with its grove of shadowy beech,)<br />
And all about the town, and through,<br />
There flowed a River fed with dew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As sweet as roses, and as clear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As mountain crystals pure and
cold,<br />
And with his waves that water kissed<br />
The gleaming altars of amethyst<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That smoke with victims all the year,<br />
And sacred are to the Gods of old.</p>
<p class="poetry">There sat three Judges by the Gate,<br />

<a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>And I might
wander at my will<br />
About that City on the hill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the happy people clad<br />

Hued like the webs that Twilight weaves<br />
At shut of languid summer eves<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So light their raiment seemed; and glad<br />
Was every face I looked on there!</p>
<p class="poetry">There was no heavy heat, no cold,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When first he won the fairy
clime.<br />
The Night falls never from on high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor ever burns the heat of noon.<br />
But such soft light eternally<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shines, as in silver dawns of June<br />
Before the Sun hath climbed the sky!</p>

BARBAROUS BIRD-GODS: A SAVAGE PARABASIS.</h3>
<p>In the <i>Aves</i> of Aristophanes, the Bird Chorus declare
that they are older than the Gods, and greater benefactors of
men.&nbsp; This idea recurs in almost all savage mythologies, and
I have made the savage Bird-gods state their own case.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>The Birds sing</i>:</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">We</span> would have you to
wit, that on eggs though we sit, and are spiked on the spit, and
are baked in the pan,<br />
Birds are older by far than your ancestors are, and made love and
made war ere the making of Man!<br />
For when all things were dark, not a glimmer nor spark, and the
world like a barque without rudder or sail<br />
Floated on through the night, &rsquo;twas a Bird struck a light,
&rsquo;twas a flash from the bright feather&rsquo;d
Tonatiu&rsquo;s <a name="citation105"></a><a href="#footnote105"
class="citation">[105]</a> tail!<br />
<a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>Then the
Hawk <a name="citation106a"></a><a href="#footnote106a"
class="citation">[106a]</a> with some dry wood flew up in the
sky, and afar, safe and high, the Hawk lit Sun and Moon,<br />
And the Birds of the air they rejoiced everywhere, and they
recked not of care that should come on them soon.<br />
For the Hawk, so they tell, was then known as Pundjel, <a
name="citation106b"></a><a href="#footnote106b"
class="citation">[106b]</a> and a-musing he fell at the close of
the day;<br />
Then he went on the quest, as we thought, of a nest, with some
bark of the best, and a clawful of clay. <a
name="citation106c"></a><a href="#footnote106c"
class="citation">[106c]</a><br />
And with these did he frame two birds lacking a name, without
feathers (his game was a puzzle to all);<br />
Next around them he fluttered a-dancing, and muttered; and,
lastly, he uttered a magical call:<br />
Then the figures of clay, as they featherless lay, they leaped
up, who but they, and embracing they fell,<br />
<a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>And
<i>this</i> was the baking of Man, and his making; but now
he&rsquo;s forsaking his Father, Pundjel!<br />
Now these creatures of mire, they kept whining for fire, and to
crown their desire who was found but the Wren?<br />
To the high heaven he came, from the Sun stole he flame, and for
this has a name in the memory of men! <a
name="citation107a"></a><a href="#footnote107a"
class="citation">[107a]</a><br />
And in India who for the Soma juice flew, and to men brought it
through without falter or fail?<br />
Why the Hawk &rsquo;twas again, and great Indra to men would
appear, now and then, in the shape of a Quail,<br />
While the Thlinkeet&rsquo;s delight is the Bird of the Night, the
beak and the bright ebon plumage of Yehl.<a

And who for man&rsquo;s need brought the famed Suttung&rsquo;s
mead? why &rsquo;tis told in the creed of the Sagamen strong,<br

<a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

the blue, and gave mortals the brew that&rsquo;s the fountain of
song. <a name="citation108a"></a><a href="#footnote108a"
class="citation">[108a]</a><br />
Next, who gave men their laws? and what reason or cause the young
brave overawes when in need of a squaw,<br />
Till he thinks it a shame to wed one of his name, and his conduct
you blame if he thus breaks the law?<br />
For you still hold it wrong if a <i>lubra</i> <a
name="citation108b"></a><a href="#footnote108b"
class="citation">[108b]</a> belong to the self-same <i>kobong</i>
<a name="citation108c"></a><a href="#footnote108c"
class="citation">[108c]</a> that is Father of you,<br />
To take <i>her</i> as a bride to your ebony side; nay, you give
her a wide berth; quite right of you, too.<br />
For her father, you know, is <i>your</i> father, the Crow, and no
blessing but woe from the wedding would spring.<br />
Well, these rules they were made in the wattle-gum shade, and
were strictly obeyed, when the Crow was the King. <a

Earth&rsquo;s little ball to the Birds you owe all, yet your
gratitude&rsquo;s small for the favours they&rsquo;ve done,<br />
And their feathers you pill, and you eat them at will, yes, you
plunder and kill the bright birds one by one;<br />
There&rsquo;s a price on their head, and the Dodo is dead, and
the Moa has fled from the sight of the sun!</p>

A sucker sticking to a stone.</p>
<p class="poetry">And we, his children, truly we<br />

Affix ourselves and are not free;<br />

<p><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>Page
<span class="indexpageno"><a href="#page3">3</a></span>.&nbsp;
<i>The Fortunate Islands</i>.&nbsp; This piece is a rhymed loose
version of a passage in the <i>Vera Historia</i> of Lucian.&nbsp;
The humorist was unable to resist the temptation to introduce
passages of mockery, which are here omitted.&nbsp; Part of his
description of the Isles of the Blest has a close and singular
resemblance to the New Jerusalem of the Apocalypse.&nbsp; The
clear River of Life and the prodigality of gold and of precious
stones may especially be noticed.</p>
<p><i>Whoso doth taste the Dead Men&rsquo;s bread</i>,
&amp;.c.&nbsp; This belief that the living may visit, on
occasion, the dwellings of the dead, but can never return to
earth if they taste the food of the departed, is expressed in
myths of worldwide distribution.&nbsp; Because she ate the
pomegranate seed, Persephone became subject to the spell of
Hades.&nbsp; In Apuleius, Psyche, when she visits the place of
souls, is advised to abstain from food.&nbsp; Kohl found the myth
among the Ojibbeways, Mr. Codrington among the Solomon Islanders;
it occurs in Samoa, in the Finnish Kalewala (where Wainamoinen,
in Pohjola, refrains from touching meat or drink), and the belief
has left its mark on the medi&aelig;val ballad of Thomas of
Ercildoune.&nbsp; When he is in Fairy Land, the Fairy Queen
supplies him with the bread and wine of earth, and will not
suffer him to touch the fruits which grow &ldquo;in this
countrie.&rdquo;&nbsp; See also &ldquo;Wandering Willie&rdquo; in
Redgauntlet.</p>
<p>Page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page20">20</a></span>.&nbsp; <i>As now the hutted
Eskimo</i>.&nbsp; The Eskimo and the <a name="page138"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>miserable Fuegians are almost the
only Socialists who practise what European Anarchists
preach.&nbsp; The Fuegians go so far as to tear up any piece of
cloth which one of the tribe may receive, so that each member may
have a rag.&nbsp; The Eskimo are scarcely such consistent
walkers, and canoes show a tendency to accumulate in the hands of
proprietors.&nbsp; Formerly no Eskimo was allowed to possess more
than one canoe.&nbsp; Such was the wild justice of the Polar
philosophers.</p>
<p>Page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page36">36</a></span>.&nbsp; <i>The latest
minstrel</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;The sound of all others dearest to his
ear, the gentle ripple of Tweed over its pebbles, was distinctly
audible as we knelt around the bed and his eldest son kissed and
closed his eyes.&rdquo;&mdash;Lockhart&rsquo;s Life of Scott,
vii., 394.</p>
<p>Page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page45">45</a></span>.&nbsp; <i>Ronsard&rsquo;s
Grave</i>.&nbsp; This version ventures to condense the original
which, like most of the works of the Pleiad, is unnecessarily
long.</p>
<p>Page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page46">46</a></span>.&nbsp; <i>The snow</i>, <i>and
wind</i>, <i>and hail</i>.&nbsp; Ronsard&rsquo;s rendering of the
famous passage in Odyssey, vi., about the dwellings of the
Olympians.&nbsp; The vision of a Paradise of learned lovers and
poets constantly recurs in the poetry of Joachim du Bellay, and
of Ronsard.</p>
<p>Page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page50">50</a></span>.&nbsp; <i>Romance</i>.&nbsp;
Suggested by a passage in La Faustin, by M. E. de Goncourt, a
curious moment of poetry in a repulsive piece of
<i>naturalisme</i>.</p>
<p>Page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page55">55</a></span>.&nbsp; <i>M. Boulmier</i>, author of
<i>Les Villanelles</i>, died shortly after this villanelle was
written; he had not published a larger collection on which he had
been at work.</p>
<p>Page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page61">61</a></span>.&nbsp; <i>Edmund Gorliot</i>.&nbsp;
The bibliophile will not easily procure Gorliot&rsquo;s book,
which is not in the catalogues.&nbsp; Throughout <i>The Last
Maying</i> there is reference to the <i>Pervigilium
Veneris</i>.</p>
<p>Page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page105">105</a></span>.&nbsp; <i>Bird-Gods</i>.&nbsp;
Apparently Aristophanes preserved, in a burlesque form, the
remnants of a genuine myth.&nbsp; Almost all savage religions
have their bird-gods, and it is probable that Aristophanes <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>did not
invent, but only used a surviving myth of which there are
scarcely any other traces in Greek literature.</p>
<p>Page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page134">134</a></span>.&nbsp; <i>Spinet</i>.&nbsp; The
accent is on the last foot, even when the word is written
<i>spinnet</i>.&nbsp; Compare the remarkable Liberty which Pamela
took with the 137th Psalm.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>My Joys and Hopes all overthrown</i>,<br />
<i>My Heartstrings almost broke</i>,<br />
<i>Unfit my Mind for Melody</i>,<br />
<i>Much more to bear a Joke</i>.<br />
<i>But yet</i>, <i>if from my Innocence</i><br />
<i>I</i>, <i>even in Thought</i>, <i>should slide</i>,<br />
<i>Then</i>, <i>let my fingers quite forget</i><br />
<i>The sweet Spinnet to guide</i>!</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method

  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
